### Using Power Tools
- When using a power tool, always make sure the line of motion you’re cutting/drilling/etc will not hit the table, wall, other tools, your hands, other people, etc. Basically anything but your work piece!
- Inspect the tool you are using for any damage. If you notice anything off or aren’t sure, stop using the tool and report it using a studio log.
- Secure your workpiece
    - Secure work with clamps or a vise, freeing both hands to operate the tool.
    - For drilling operations, it is best to use a vice to safely secure the piece
    - For cutting, use clamps and/or the sawhorses to safely secure the piece
- Use safe practice
    - Disconnect tools when not in use, before servicing, and when changing accessories such as blades, bits, and cutters.
    - Ensure all guards and shields are in place before turning on equipment.
    - Unplug power tool to change blade/bit
    - Keep hands and fingers away from the moving parts of a power tool
    - Keep hands and fingers out of the path of cutting or drilling
    - Avoid accidental starting. Do not hold a finger on the switch button while carrying an armed/powered tool.
- Take care of your tools and they will take care of you
    - Never carry an electric tool by the cord.
    - Never yank the cord to disconnect it from the outlet.
    - Keep cords away from heat, oil, and sharp edges.
    - Maintain tools with care, keeping them sharp and clean for the best performance. 
- Power Down
    - Turn off all power tools.
    - Remove bits from drills/dremels/router and return them to their cases.
    - Return tools to their proper area

## Cleaning up

## First Aid
The Workshop can be a uniquely dangerous environment. There's an unusual amount of sharp stuff, hot stuff, and heavy stuff. These policies are included in the first aid manual which you will learn the location of during your in-person training.

### Jump to section
- [In case of an accident](#in-case-of-an-accident)
- [Treating Minor Wounds](#treating-minor-wounds)
- [Treating Severe Bleeding](#treating-severe-bleeding)

### In case of an accident

1. Remove the person from immediate danger
2. Find help and call 911 if necessary
3. Use the first aid kit next to the door
4. Once everyone is safe and accounted for, [follow the University of Michigan reporting policies](https://ehs.umich.edu/research-clinical/reporting-incidents/)
5. Report the incident in a studio log

SMTD has a program called BIRT, or the Building Incident Response Team. All BIRT members are trained in the administration of CPR and the use of an AED. During the day there is likely a BIRT member near by. However, only leave a victim if its safe and reasonable to do so. Otherwise call 911.

### Treating Minor Wounds
Minor wounds include abrasions, lacerations, punctures and incisions. The most significant issues to consider with any open wound are control of bleeding and infection.

**Signs and Symptoms**
- Break, cut or opening in the skin
- Bleeding may be minor, moderate or severe
- Bruising and pain
- Infection
- Progressing shock

**First Aid**
- If bleeding, apply direct pressure with a clean cloth or absorbent pad
- Wash area with antibacterial soap and clean until there appears to be no foreign matter in the wound
- Cover area with an adhesive bandage or gauze wrap

### Treating Severe Bleeding
**Emergency Action Steps**
1. **Assess the scene:** if the scene is unsafe or becomes unsafe, get out! Only move the patient if absolutely necessary.
2. **Assess the victim:** Tap shoulder, shout name. No response??
3. **Alert:** Have someone call 911 for help. If you are alone, make the call yourself.
4. Attend to any life threatening problems.

- **Apply Direct Pressure:**
    1. Rip or cut away clothing so the wound can be seen.
    2. Place a clean absorbent pad directly over the wound.
    3. Apply firm, direct pressure over the wound.
    4. The victim can assist if they are able.

- **Apply Pressure Bandage:** Wrap a conforming bandage securely over the pad to maintain pressure and hold the gauze in place.
    Bandage should be loose enough so a finger can slip under the bandage.

- **If Bleeding Continues:**
    1. As the first dressings become soaked with blood, apply more pads, dressings and maintain firm, direct pressure.
    2. Do not remove the first dressings, just continue to add more if soaking through continues.

- **Managing Shock:**
    1. Ensure an open airway for the victim and adequate breathing.
    2. Keep the bleeding under control.
    3. Prevent chilling or overheating.
    4. Keep the victim lying flat with feet slightly elevated if possible.

### Treating Burns
- Thermal Burns are caused by sun, fire, hot liquids or objects and sometimes hot gasses.
- Chemical Burns are caused by contact with wet or dry chemicals.
- Electrical Burns are caused by contact with electrical wires, current, or lightning.

**Considerations during fire or electrocution**
- If a victim is on fire, tell them to STOP, DROP, and ROLL.
- If a victim is in contact with electricity DO NOT TOUCH them until the source of electricity has been shut off.

#### Minor Burns
**Signs and Symptoms**
- Pain, Redness
- Swelling, Blisters

**First Aid**
- Expose the burn
- Cool burns with cold water (or instant ice pack) and continue until pain lessens
- After cooling, cover with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing
- Protect from friction /pressure
- DO NOT pop blisters or apply any ointment or other substance

#### Major Burns
**Signs and Symptoms**
- Dry/leathery, white, or blackened, charred skin

**First Aid**
- Call 911
- Assess/Alert/Attend to any life threatening problems
- If caused by a liquid chemical, flush with large amounts of water right away 

### Treating Shock
Shock develops when not enough blood flows to the vital organs of the body. Victims with shock may stop responding. Common causes of shock are:
- Severe bleeding
- Nervous system injuries
- Heart attack or other heart problem
- Severe burns
- Severe allergic reaction
- Dehydration

**Signs and Symptoms**
- Dizziness, faint or weak feeling
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Anxiety, restlessness, agitation, or confusion
- Cool and clammy to the touch
- Pale or grayish skin
- Thirst
- Nausea or vomiting

**First Aid**
- Call 911 and Activate EMS
- Help the person lie on their back
- Keep the victim lying flat with feet slightly elevated if possible
- Cover the person to keep them warm, but prevent overheating
- Ensure an open airway for the victim and adequate breathing
- Monitor the victim and administer CPR if necessary

### Treating Eye Injuries
- Eye injuries can range from minor irritations to severe and sight threatening. 
- Injuries are frequently caused by objects in the eye, burns, and blunt force injuries. 
- Any of these conditions or situations can lead to permanent loss of vision.

**Eye injuries can be prevented/mitigated by...**
- Wearing protective eyewear during risky activities.
- Exercising caution with chemicals and cleaners.

**Signs and Symptoms**
- Pain, redness, stinging
- Burning, itching
- Bleeding/bruising in or around eyes
- Sensitivity to light
- Decreased or double vision
- Loss of vision
- Something actually visibly stuck in eye

**First Aid**
- Rinse eye with saline solution or tap water if saline is not available.
- Do not try to remove object
- Do not allow the victim to rub or apply pressure to the injured eye
- Cover the eye lightly with a gauze pad or clean cloth
- Seek medical attention

### Treating Diabetic Emergencies
Diabetes is a chronic condition that causes an imbalance of blood sugar and insulin. Emergencies can occur if someone’s blood sugar becomes very high or very low.

**Signs and Symptoms**
- Shakiness
- Dizziness
- Sweating
- Hunger
- Irritability or moodiness
- Anxiety or nervousness
- Headache, vision problems
- Drowsiness
- Seizures

**First Aid Interventions**
- One tablespoon of sugar, jelly or honey, or
- Three glucose tablets, or
- Four ounces of fruit juice or regular, not diet, soda, or
- Administer 5 to 6 pieces of hard candy

Utilize above interventions only if the victim is alert — if not alert or appears confused, call 911. 

## Fire Safety
For your safety and the safety of others at the University of Michigan, it is a good practice to know when to fight a fire, which fire extinguisher to use, and how to put out a fire. The first decision you must make when a fire occurs is to only fight a fire if:
- The fire is small and contained
- You are safe from toxic smoke
- You have a means of escape
- Your instincts tell you it is OK

If at any time one of these criteria changes, **SOUND THE ALARM** and evacuate the area immediately.

### Using a fire extinguisher
Even though extinguishers come in a number of shapes and sizes, they all operate in a similar manner.  An easy acronym for fire extinguisher use is PASS: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep.

![](/_media/ws-pass.webp)

Stand approximately 8 feet away from the fire and...
1. **PULL** the pin at the top of the extinguisher that keeps the handle from being accidentally pressed.
2. **AIM** the nozzle toward the base of the fire.
3. **SQUEEZE** the handle to discharge the extinguisher. If you release the handle, the discharge will stop.
4. **SWEEP** the nozzle back and forth at the base of the fire.  After the fire appears to be out, watch carefully because it may re-ignite.

Note that some types of fires require special fire retardants that may not be available in your specific extinguisher. If an extinguisher appears to have no affect, or you run out of retardant, sound the alarm and evacuate the area.
