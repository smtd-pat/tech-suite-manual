## House Lights
The house/work lights in Davis, along with the vestibule and adjacent hallway, are controlled by a single system that integrates with the Davis lighting system. Small buttons on black panels that illuminate blue can be used to control a specific zone such as the vestibule and hallway lights when needed. The Davis lighting is controlled by a touch panel on the back wall next to the door leading to the hallway or using the illuminated blue button next to the main exit door.

?> **Tip:** Pressing the blue button next to the main exit door can turn the Davis house lights on and off. If the lights were turned on using the touch panel, you may need to press this button a few times to turn the lights off.

### Touch Panel
!> The layout of the touch panel is getting updated in the near future. This section may no longer be relevent.

?> Use Preset 6 when leaving the room

1. All On
2. Projection
3. Performance Dim Center
4. Performance
5. Performance with dim wings
6. Turn off all lights. **Use when leaving the room.**

**Off:** Leaves guide lights on. **Use for performances. Do not use to turn lights off.**

## Speaker Power Switches

<!-- panels:start -->

### Main L-R Pair Speaker Power

<!-- div:left-panel -->

The Genelec 1037Cs are the large “front-of-house” speakers on either side of the projection screen. Their power is controlled by a black power switch on the lectern.

<!-- div:right-panel -->

![](/_media/davis-lectern-speaker-power.webp)

<!-- div:left-panel -->

### Surround System / Subwoofer Power

Located on the downstage-side of the I-beam support pillar between the lighting and audio console, the speaker power switch will turn on the sequenced grey outlets. Currently it should be configured to turn on all the Genelec 8050Bs, Genelec 8040Bs, and RCF Subs.

This switch is always unlocked.

<!-- div:right-panel -->

![](/_media/davis-speaker-system-switch.webp)

<!-- panels:end -->

## Power Outlets

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:left-panel -->
The grey outlets can be programmed by the Tech Suite administrators to turn on and off in a specific order using the [speaker system power switch](#speaker-system-power). The sequence is very rarely changed.

All outlets are labeled as shown above, replacing ## with a unique number.
<br><small>Note that some numbers appear more than once on the grey panels which indicates they are on the same programmable relay.</small>

All grey outlets are programmed to be perpetually on, except for **RP-372-14** which provides power to a few speakers and hence is turned on and off using the [speaker system power switch](#speaker-system-power).

They grey outlets also provide an **Isolated Ground**. This can help reduce or eliminate RF interference that can often affect sensitive audio equipment and speakers.

<!-- div:right-panel -->
![](/_media/davis-black-outlet.webp 'Building Mains Power :size=60%')
![](/_media/davis-grey-outlet.webp 'Programmable / Isolated Ground :size=60%')

<!-- panels:end -->

## Projector

!> Please be extremely careful around the projector screen. Please don't put chairs or tables up against it and use care not to scuff, scratch, or rip it.

The projector power is controlled via a remote on the teaching station. This remote must be plugged into its ⅛” adapter in order to communicate with the projector.

The projector input is controlled with the [Video Switcher][video-switcher] which can be accessed from the Davis Computer.

</details>

The larger Genelec 8050B speakers around the top of the room, along with the 1037Cs described below, are part of a 14-channel surround speaker array.

The surround speakers are best used via the **DEFAULT** or **DIFFUSION** project files on the Roland M-5000 mixing console.

### Main Speakers

<!-- TODO: Images -->

The main "front-of-house" speakers are Genelec 1037Cs. They can be routed to the Dante network output or the Teaching Station audio interface using a knob on top of the audio interface. Make sure to turn the knob all the way to the left or right depending on which input source you wish to use.

The smaller Genelec 8040B speakers are part of a 22-channel ambisonic isohedron aimed at the spike at the center of the room.

The ambisonic system is best utilized through a specialized Max patch or the Ambisonic Playback template file for Reaper, both of which are in the shared drive on the Davis Computer. Please consult the Studio Coordinator on proper usage.

<!-- panels:end -->

### Loudspakers
The ElectroVoice ETX-10Ps are high SPL loudspeakers that can be used during concerts. Please consult the Studio Coordinator if you wish to use these.

!> **You must use a mixer in the signal chain leading to these speakers!** Do NOT attempt to route anything directly to these speakers via Dante or otherwise or you will quickly learn what Tinnitus sounds like.

## Roland M-5000 Basics
The power switch to the M-5000 is located on the back of the console above the power cable. Generally the console saves all your changes as you make them, so when you are done you can just turn the console off. However to ensure you can get back to your configuration if someone changes it, you should save it as a project file.

> You may ask the Studio Coordinator about how to use the Diffusion and EV Speakers project files.

## Lighting System

This manual only contains basic documentation on the lighting system. Keep in mind that you must have a Davis Studio L Certification to use the system. For information on using the console, please refer to the [console’s manual](https://www.etcconnect.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=10737510864).

### ETC Ion Basics

ETC provides [offline software](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Consoles/Eos-Family/) that can be run on nearly any computer. This software includes a 3D visualizer that can be used to construct light plots and program shows without being in Davis.

A complete series of video tutorials on the EOS software that runs on the Ion is provided by ETC on their website. Simply find the feature you need help with. You can also hold down the “Help” key on the console or in the EOS offline software and press the key you need help with.

<!-- TODO: Finish lighting documentation transfer -->

### Gateway Information
The Davis lighting system currently operates entirely in Universe 51. The console connects via DMX, not Net3, which means we currently cannot control additional universes. However the DMX gateways can be reconfigured if desired.
