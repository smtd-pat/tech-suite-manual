## House Lights
The house/work lights in Davis, along with the vestibule and adjacent hallway, are controlled by a single system that integrates with the Davis lighting system. Small buttons on black panels that illuminate blue can be used to control a specific zone such as the vestibule and hallway lights when needed. The Davis lighting is controlled by a touch panel on the back wall next to the door leading to the hallway or using the illuminated blue button next to the main exit door.

?> **Tip:** Pressing the blue button next to the main exit door can turn the Davis house lights on and off. If the lights were turned on using the touch panel, you may need to press this button a few times to turn the lights off.

### Touch Panel
Use the touch panel next to the north side door to control the Davis overhead lights

## Power Outlets

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:left-panel -->
The grey outlets can be programmed by the Tech Suite administrators to turn on and off in a specific order using the [speaker system power switch](#speaker-system-power). The sequence is very rarely changed.

All outlets are labeled as shown above, replacing ## with a unique number.
<br><small>Note that some numbers appear more than once on the grey panels which indicates they are on the same programmable relay.</small>

All grey outlets are typically programmed to be perpetually on, however some provide power to a few speakers and hence is turned on and off using the [speaker system power switch](#speaker-system-power).

They grey outlets also provide an **Isolated Ground**. This can help reduce or eliminate RF interference that can often affect sensitive audio equipment and speakers.

## Lectern

### Mixer as audio interface

The Yamaha MG10XU will show up as **MG-XU** in the audio device list on the MTL computer or your laptop if its plugged into USB.

#### Audio Out
1. Ensure the **USB/Line** button is pressed for USB on channel 9/10 
2. Ensure the **TO MON/TO ST** button is depressed for TO MON
3. Turn up the red master volume knob

#### Audio In
Audio input can be received from channels 1 and 2

1. Press the **Stereo Mute** button above the master volume. This will stop the mixer from its default behavior of directly outputting sound to the speakers from the inputs.
2. In your software of choice, set the input to 1 or 2. Ensure the gain and volume on channels 1 and/or 2 are set to your desired levels.

!> Make sure to turn down the master volume when depressing the **Stereo Mute** button! Otherwise you could be in for a lot of sound!

## Projector

!> Please be extremely careful around the projector screen. Please don't put chairs or tables up against it and use care not to scuff, scratch, or rip it.

The projector power is controlled via a remote on the teaching station. This remote must be plugged into its ⅛” adapter in order to communicate with the projector.

The projector input is controlled with the [Video Switcher][video-switcher] which can be accessed from the Davis Computer.

## Speakers and routing

?> The system was recently updated and new documentation is in the works.

## Lighting System

This manual only contains basic documentation on the lighting system. Keep in mind that you must have a Davis Studio L Certification to use the system. For information on using the console, please refer to the [console’s manual](https://www.etcconnect.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=10737510864).

### ETC Ion Basics

ETC provides [offline software](https://www.etcconnect.com/Products/Consoles/Eos-Family/) that can be run on nearly any computer. This software includes a 3D visualizer that can be used to construct light plots and program shows without being in Davis.

A complete series of video tutorials on the EOS software that runs on the Ion is provided by ETC on their website. Simply find the feature you need help with. You can also hold down the “Help” key on the console or in the EOS offline software and press the key you need help with.

<!-- TODO: Finish lighting documentation transfer -->

### Gateway Information
The Davis lighting system currently operates entirely in Universe 51. The console connects via DMX, not Net3, which means we currently cannot control additional universes. However the DMX gateways can be reconfigured if desired.

### Reserved Address in Universe 51
Do not patch lights to these addresses
