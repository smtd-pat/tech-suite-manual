# Motion Capture System
The Davis Studio is outfitted with a Qualisys Miqus motion capture system.

?> In order to get the most accurate calibration and use, the area should be cleared of all reflective surfaces, tables, chairs and the whiteboard.

## Startup

1. Plug the data/power cable into the sync box.

All the cameras are daisy chained together so only one data cable needs to be connected. The cameras use a proprietary ethernet-like connector so please be gentle with it as its difficult to replace. The data/power cable should be tied up on the I-beam.

3. Turn on the secondary power injector switch located on the front-right side of the room.

The sync box doesn't deliver enough power for all the cameras, so a second power injector is needed.
