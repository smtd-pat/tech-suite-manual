## Using your own computer

![](/_media/mtl-laptop.webp ':size=50%')

Every MTL station grants you the ability to use your own personal laptop in lieu of the provided computers. Instructions are provided on a sticker, but lets quickly go over it here.

1. Plug in your latoptop to the USB-C cable labeled "Laptop"
2. Press the button (shown above) so that "2" is illuminated.

This will allow you to use the audio interface, MIDI keyboard, and Ableton Push with your own laptop. It will also license any software stored on our iLok license USB, if you have iLok and the respective software installed.

**You never should unplug anything from the back of the computer stations**
