# ClearCom System
![ClearCom PS-702 front panel](/_media/clearcom-rack.webp)
ClearCom is a way for you to communicate across the Tech Suite using wired headsets. You may want to do this for a number of reasons such as trying to troubleshoot a problem or to communicate with crew while running a performance or recording session. The ClearCom system goes to Britton, Macintosh, Hankinson, Watkins, the Edit Rooms, the Control Room, and Davis.

The intercom system has an A and B channel. On the front panel of the PS-702 main station (located in the Machine Room), you are able to plug a beltpack directly into the system and talk with either channel A or B using the switch. You can also link A and B together if needed. There is currently no program feed hooked up to the ClearCom system and flipping the switch will not do anything. 

!> Please do not adjust the send levels or turn the Test Tone on.

The ClearCom belt packs can be connected to the system using XLR cables. Locate the A and B intercom ports on select AV panels. Belt packs that are supposed to be on the same channel can be daisy chained together. A headset or handset can then be plugged into the headset port on each beltpack.

- Press the talk button momentarily to toggle talk mode on. Press again to turn off.
- Press the call button to illuminate the orange call LED on other beltpacks.
