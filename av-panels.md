# AV Panels

AV Panels are large black wall plates and grid boxes (boxes in the Davis pipe grid) with a number of ports that lead into the [Machine Room][machine-room]. Below is an example of an AV panel. These can found all over the Tech Suite, as well as in Britton recital hall, MacIntosh recital hall, Hankinson rehearsal hall, and Watkins lecture hall. Below is Davis AVP-101, which has every port that can be found on a Tech Suite AV panel. Each panel and port is labeled to make it easier to find in the Machine Room patch bay. Note that not all panels look alike or have the same ports.

## Line types

Each line has a designated purpose. Make sure you are using the right line for the right task.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Microphone**

!> Do not use for line level or amplified signals

Microphone lines are XLR lines dedicated to patching Microphones in the machine room.

### **Tie Line**
<div class="tip">
Please

- Do not use for amplified signals
- Only send a signal in one direction per tie line
- Do not plug in devices to both a top and bottom port
- Turn speakers off or controllers down before patching

</div>

Tie Lines are bi-directional connections (hence the XLRP connectors on the top row) for line level devices that can be patched into an amplifier, other device, or other AV Panel using the machine room patch panel.

The top and bottom ports both go to the same tie line channel, as indicated by the connecting line.

The bottom row ports are Combojacks and hence will accept both XLRP and TR/TRS connectors.

### **AV Data**
AV Data links are RJ45 CAT6 lines that run to the machine room patch panels. These can be patched into the Dante network, into the campus internet via ethernet, or directed to another AV panel.

## **Intercom**
Intercom links are connected to the ClearCom rack in the machine room. They allow technicians to communicate during a performance. 

!> Only use these ports with compatible ClearCom beltpacks. Never plug anything else into the intercom port.

### **Video**
Video links are BNC connections that run to the machine room patch panels. These can be patched into the video switcher, or directed to another AV panel.

### **MM Fiber**
The multimode fiber port can be used with fiber optic devices and patched in the machine room.

### **Word Clock**
The Word Clock port can be used to sync digital devices so they can communicate properly. However, since the studios primarily use Dante for routing, this syncing is handled automatically for all Dante devices.

## Other AV panels

Additional AV panels for the Tech Suite can be found in Hankinson, Watkins, MacIntosh, and Britton
